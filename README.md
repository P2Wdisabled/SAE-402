The game: \
In this game, the player has to move around a city in England, such as London or Liverpool. This will allow him to interact and communicate with NPC. Interactions can take different forms: \
    • Have the choice between 2 questions and must choose the right one, if we give the wrong one the character will answer the wrong one and this can give bad reactions \
    • Have to find the right translation, if we give the wrong one the character will respond to the wrong and it can give bad reactions
